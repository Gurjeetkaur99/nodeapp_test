Continuous Integration pipeline

A CI (Continuous Integration) pipeline typically consists of steps like code commit, build, automated testing, code analysis, and sometimes a pre-deployment stage, where each step automatically validates code changes, ensuring quality and enabling rapid feedback loops by integrating code frequently into a shared repository, allowing for early detection of issues. 

Key CI pipeline steps and their purpose:

Source Code Commit:
Developers commit their code changes to the version control system (like Git), triggering the CI pipeline. 

Build:
The code is compiled and packaged into an executable format, creating a build artifact. 

Unit Testing:
Automated unit tests are run to verify individual code components function as expected. 

Integration Testing:
Tests are performed to check how different code components interact with each other. 

Code Analysis:
Static code analysis tools scan the code for potential issues like security vulnerabilities, coding style inconsistencies, and code complexity.

Artifact Management:
The built artifacts (e.g., compiled code, test reports) are stored in a repository for later use.
